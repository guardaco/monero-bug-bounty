# Monero Bug Bounty

Hey, Monero community! 
Monero XMR is now functioning in Guarda wallet Web and Desktop versions, all thanks to your help and support! We knew that Monero is great at teamwork and you are always here to prove it. 
Now, as we have supported XMR in our wallet, we would like to ask you for the community helping hand to test the wallet functions.

So, we are announcing the Monero Wallet bug bounty. The community member who provides the most useful/detailed solving solution for the bugs they have found will get a prize of **3 XMR**, two more participants with the most noteworthy solutions will get **1 XMR** each. Also, all the participants will get our special XMR-edition **collectable tokens**. 
If you are in with the testing, get your Guarda XMR wallet on https://guarda.co/, try it out and drop your suggestions to our GitHub. Be sure that your brilliant ideas will be used in wallet development. All hail the community work and thank you all for the support!

Note: the testing period will last for a month, starting today. After these 30 days are over, we will announce the end of Monero bug bounty and distribute the prizes.
